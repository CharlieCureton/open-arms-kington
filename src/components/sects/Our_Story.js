                A collection of like-minded local people has come together to explore the potential of one of the town’s significant historic buildings, the Oxford Arms. The aim is to give this ancient hostelry a thriving 21st century life as a self-sustaining ‘Hub &amp; Pub’.

                Having learned that the Oxford was on the market, it seemed like an ideal solution for our goal of a community hub. It is a spacious, well-loved local venue and had the potential to house a self-financing community enterprise. One of the most significant difficulties of community efforts is sustainability after initial funding, either from grants or other sources, runs out. The turnover from an already established local business (restaurant, pub, B&amp;B) would provide financial stability for a community organisation. Thus, OAK came into being.

                In its extended role as a contemporary community resource, the Oxford would house a dedicated youth space and offer a wide range of activities accessible for all. We hope to create a hub that presents opportunities for a wide range of ages and abilities, nurtures community resilience and secures a thriving future for this landmark building.
